# Magnetic Field Mapping Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we use a compass and two bar magnets in order to map magnetic fields on paper, and compare their behavior based on the similarity of their orientations. This will also allow us to prove for ourselves wheter opposites really attract and opposites repel.

## Materials

- Two bar magnets
- Compass
- 11 x 17 inch paper
- Tape

## Procedure

First clear away from the table top any magnets or iron or steel objects. Place your compass in the middle
of the table and determine the direction of north. In your classroom (Rooms 14 and 16 of Nicholson Hall)
north is approximately opposite the windows. The steel in the building structure may cause your compass
to point in a slightly different direction.

Stack on top of one another one of the large sheets of
paper for each person in your lab group (i.e., for you
and one partner, stack two sheets). Put a bar magnet
on top of the sheets, orienting the bar magnet so that
its long dimension runs north-south. Turn the paper so
that its long dimension is roughly perpendicular to the
long dimension of the magnet. Look at the figure for
clarification. It doesn’t really matter which end of the bar
magnet is towards the north, pick either orientation you
like.

Use some tape to secure the paper to the table, and trace
the outline of the bar magnet with a pen or pencil. Identify
(using your compass) which end of the bar magnet is the
north pole. (Don’t trust any markings on the magnet, they
have been known to be incorrect. Label on your paper which is the north pole of the magnet.
Now use your compass to create a map of the magnetic field lines around the magnet. Do this by placing
the compass in a starting point (several suggested starting points are shown in the figure as dots), and
turning the compass until the needle lines up with the two holes in the base. One it’s aligned, stick a
pencil into each hole and make a dot. Move the compass to one side or the other, but arrange it so one
of the holes in the base is directly over one of your pencil dots. Align the needle with the holes and make
another pencil dot. Continue this process in both directions to complete the field line. You might wish to
connect the dots as you go along, or wait till later. In either case, when you do connect the dots, use an
arrowhead to indicate the direction that the north (red) needle of the compass was pointing. Begin again at
another convenient starting point and repeat the mapping process several times until you have traced out a
few (need not be more than five or so) lines on each side of the magnet and a two or three lines near each end.

To allow both you and your partner(s) to have a copy of the field map, use a push pin and poke through
the paper at each pencil dot so that you prick the sheet(s) below. This will allow an accurate copy of the
original map to be produced.

After you’ve done the first map, obtain some fresh sheets of paper and map another case where you orient
the bar magnet in an east-west direction, again keeping the long dimension of the paper perpendicular to
the long dimension of the magnet.

Make two more field maps of the region in between the poles of two separate bar magnets. Try each of the
orientations shown in the figure below. Trace six or more lines spaced across the region of the facing poles.

Use a fresh stack of paper for each case.

## Data

### Case 1

### Case 2

## Data Analysis

When looking at case 1, where opposite sides are facing each other, we can see the the magnetic field goes through both of the magnets, splits, then circles back around merging, forming a complete unified loop.

In case 2, where the same sides are facing each other, the fields mostly seem like they're seperate, only merging a bit at the right side.

From this, we can conclude that, opposite sides of a magnet do actually attract each other, and merge their magnetic fields to an extent. Likewise, the opposite is true for when the same sides are next to each other, causing the fields to not merge and repel each other.

## Error Analysis

We didn't really follow the instructions, which would have led to messier and less accurate results. We specifically placed the arrows and lines in arbitrtary positions, using our own inaccurate arbitary method, contrary to the instructions provided.

## Conclusion

We were able to prove the that opposite sides to indeed attract each other, while the same sides repel. While our methodology was exteremely flawed, and we failed to follow the instructions, we were able to grasp a more visual understanding of the mechanics of magnetic fields, and specifically how they interact with each other.
